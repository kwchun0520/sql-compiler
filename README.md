# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.




## SQL Compiler for DataForm
This project is a SQL compiler for DataForm, which allows you to write SQL code that can be compiled into a format suitable for execution in various data processing environments.
It provides a set of tools and utilities to parse, analyze, and transform SQL code, making it easier to work with complex SQL queries and data transformations.

## Running the Project in Development Mode
To run the project in development mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and allow you to work on the project with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled.
